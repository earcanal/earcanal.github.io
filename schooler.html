 into both mindfulness and mind-wandering has grown rapidly, yet 
clarification of the relationship between these two seemingly opposing 
constructs is still absent. A first study addresses the relationship 
between a dispositional measure of mindfulness (Mindful Attention and 
Awareness Scale, MAAS) and converging measures of both self-reported and
 indirect markers of mind-wandering. Negative correlations between 
dispositional mindfulness and 4 measures of mind-wandering confirm the 
opposing relationship between the 2 constructs and further validate the 
use of the MAAS as a dispositional measure of mindfulness. A second 
study demonstrated that 8 minutes of mindful breathing reduces 
behavioral indicators of mind-wandering during a Sustained Attention to 
Response Task compared with both passive relaxation and reading. 
Together these studies clarify the opposition between the constructs of 
mindfulness and mind-wandering and so should lead to greater convergence
 between what have been predominately separate, yet mutually relevant, 
lines of research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights

 that the ability to attend to a task without distraction underlies 
performance in a wide variety of contexts, training one's ability to 
stay on task should result in a similarly broad enhancement of 
performance. In a randomized controlled investigation, we examined 
whether a 2-week mindfulness-training course would decrease mind 
wandering and improve cognitive performance. Mindfulness training 
improved both GRE reading-comprehension scores and working memory 
capacity while simultaneously reducing the occurrence of distracting 
thoughts during completion of the GRE and the measure of working memory.
 Improvements in performance following mindfulness training were 
mediated by reduced mind wandering among participants who were prone to 
distraction at pretesting. Our results suggest that cultivating 
mindfulness is an effective and efficient technique for improving 
cognitive function, with wide-reaching consequences.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class="tags">Tags:</h3><ul class="class" tags="tags"><li>Adult</li><li>Attention</li><li>Cognition</li><li>cognitive ability</li><li>Comprehension</li><li>Educational Measurement</li><li>Female</li><li>Humans</li><li>Male</li><li>MEMORY</li><li>Memory, Short-Term</li><li>mindfulness</li><li>Mind wandering</li><li>Reading</li><li>reading comprehension</li><li>Students</li><li>working memory capacity</li><li>Young Adult</li></ul></li><li id="item-5882" class="item journalArticle"><h2><a href="zotero://select/items/3554266_8GBKFVID">Mind wandering “Ahas” versus mindful reasoning: alternative routes to creative solutions</a></h2><table><tbody><tr class="creator author"><th class="author">Author</th><td>Claire M.

 on mixed results linking both mindfulness and its opposing construct 
mind wandering to enhanced creativity, we predicted that the 
relationship between mindfulness and creativity might depend on whether 
creative problems are approached through analytic strategy or through 
“insight” (i.e., sudden awareness of a solution). Study 1 investigated 
the relationship between trait mindfulness and compound remote 
associates problem solving as a function of participants’ self-reported 
approach to each problem. The results revealed a negative relationship 
between mindfulness and problem-solving overall. However, more detailed 
analysis revealed that mindfulness was associated with impaired problem 
solving when approaching problems with insight, but increased problem 
solving when using analysis. In Study 2, we manipulated participants’ 
problem-solving approach through instructions. We again found a negative
 relationship between mindfulness and creative performance in general, 
however, more mindful participants again performed better when 
instructed to approach problems analytically.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class="tags">Tags:</h3><ul class="class" tags="tags"><li>analytic problem solving</li><li>compound remote associates problems</li><li>Creativity</li><li>experiment</li><li>insight problem solving</li><li>mindfulness</li><li>Mind wandering</li></ul></li><li id="item-5842" class="item journalArticle"><h2><a href="zotero://select/items/3554266_V7KVQ65J">Signal or noise: brain network interactions underlying the experience and training of mindfulness</a></h2><table><tbody><tr class="creator author"><th class="author">Author</th><td>Benjamin W.

 broad set of brain regions has been associated with the experience and 
training of mindfulness. Many of these regions lie within key intrinsic 
brain networks, including the executive control, salience, and default 
networks. In this paper, we review the existing literature on the 
cognitive neuroscience of mindfulness through the lens of network 
science. We describe the characteristics of the intrinsic brain networks
 implicated in mindfulness and summarize the relevant findings 
pertaining to changes in functional connectivity (FC) within and between
 these networks. Convergence across these findings suggests that 
mindfulness may be associated with increased FC between two regions 
within the default network: the posterior cingulate cortex and the 
ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Additionally, extensive meditation 
experience may be associated with increased FC between the insula and 
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. However, little consensus has 
emerged within the existing literature owing to the diversity of 
operational definitions of mindfulness, neuroimaging methods, and 
network characterizations. We describe several challenges to develop a 
coherent cognitive neuroscience of mindfulness and to provide detailed 
recommendations for future research.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class="tags">Tags:</h3><ul class="class" tags="tags"><li>brain networks</li><li>functional connectivity</li><li>meditation</li><li>mindfulness</li><li>review</li></ul></li></ul></body></html>
